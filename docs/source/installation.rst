Install
=======

The easiest way to install AbStar locally (on OSX or Linux) is to use pip::

    $ pip install abstar

If you don't have pip, the Anaconda_ Python distribution contains pip along 
with a ton of useful scientific Python packages and is a great way to get 
started with Python.

Windows users can run AbStar with Docker::

    $ docker pull briney/abstar
    $ docker run -it briney/abstar

Stable_ and development_ versions of AbStar can also be downloaded from Github. 
You can manually install the latest development version of AbStar with::

    $ git clone https://github.com/briney/abstar
    $ cd abstar/
    $ python setup.py install

If installing manually via setup.py and you don't already have scikit-bio installed, 
you may get an error when setuptools attempts to install scikit-bio. This can be fixed 
by first installing scikit-bio with pip::

    $ pip install scikit-bio

and then retrying the manual install of AbStar.
